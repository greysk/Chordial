## Note on changes in this branch

See [changelog.md](/changelog.md) and the linked commits inside for details.

The major/most import changes done are in these two commits:
1. [first commit done by me](https://github.com/greysk/Chordial/commit/6d8c0e0da774dba490ba06a408af67ac45bd998c)#3 in the changelog.
2. [third commit done by me](https://github.com/greysk/Chordial/commit/798e79753a05cc5b458c6fda1739907aa7e7ec7f)

The second commit is mainly matching the code to PEP8 which has nothing to do with how the code runs.
